# Your Decent Looking JQuery Calendar

This is just a custom JQuery datepicker that I followed from a tutorial online.

## The Story Behind

There was a time when I was developing a small web application, and it came to a phase where I wanted to add a datepicker. I've scoured the internet to find something that I could just sprinkle into my simple PHP pag. However, I couldn't find any decent ones that I can easily integrate with.

The easiest DatePicker that I can find is the same old JQuery Datepicker. But the JQuery datepicker's default design is just not the one I'm looking for. So, I decided to find a way to customize it, and I stumbled upon a blog article that allowed me to reach my goal.
