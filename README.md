# Your Decent Looking JQuery Calendar

This is just a custom JQuery datepicker that I followed from a tutorial online.

## The Story Behind

There was a time when I was developing a small web application, and it came to a phase where I wanted to add a datepicker. I've scoured the internet to find something that I could just sprinkle into my simple PHP page, but I couldn't find any decent DatePicker that I can easily integrate to my web page.

The easiest DatePicker that I could find I could find is the JQuery Datepicker. However, the JQuery datepicker's default design is just not the one I'm looking for. So, I decided to find a way to customize it, and I stumbled upon a blog article that allowed me to reach my goal.
